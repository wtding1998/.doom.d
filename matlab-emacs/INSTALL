Installation:

** DEPENDANCIES

This matlab-emacs build system now requires the CEDET suite.
If you are using Emacs version 23.2 or later, you should have
everything you need.

For older versions of Emacs, visit:

   http://cedet.sf.net

The build system uses EDE for project management, Makefile creation,
and autoload generation.

** BUILD

To build:

  make

To build using an alternate version of CEDET:

   make CEDET_PATH=~/my/cedet/lisp/

It is possible to use matlab.el, and associated programs without this
extra package.  To do so, install and compile only those lisp files
you need.

** CONFIGURE EMACS

To install all the Emacs tools for MATLAB, add this to your .emacs file:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/matlab_el")
  (require 'matlab-load)

** CUSTOMIZATION:

To customize the behavior of MATLAB mode, customize the matlab group:

M-x customize-group RET matlab RET

Some popular customization options:

  (setq matlab-indent-function-body t)  ; if you want function bodies indented

  (setq matlab-verify-on-save-flag nil) ; turn off auto-verify on save

  (defun my-matlab-mode-hook ()
    (setq fill-column 76))		; where auto-fill should wrap

  (add-hook 'matlab-mode-hook 'my-matlab-mode-hook)

  (defun my-matlab-shell-mode-hook ()
	'())

  (add-hook 'matlab-shell-mode-hook 'my-matlab-shell-mode-hook)

Please read the mode help for matlab-mode for additional
configuration options.


** TLC

To use this mode without using the full install, put the this file
into your load path, and add the following to your .emacs file:

  (require 'tlc)
or
  (autoload 'tlc-mode "tlc" "tlc Editing Mode" t)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.tlc$" . tlc-mode))
  (setq tlc-indent-function t)
